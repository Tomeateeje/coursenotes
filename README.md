**Course notes for the uOttawa CS specialization program marked up in LaTeX with exported PDFs and graphic assets. No electives are included.**

### What you will find here
* Source LaTeX files for the course notes in the core uOttawa CS
  Specialisation courses. Some of these are incomplete, but generally,
  they're missing only very small bits and pieces. Please report an
  issue in GitHub with the correction. Your correction will be
  archived, and you will be credited in this readme upon the next pull
  request.

* The PDF exports. These can be found in the same file as the source
  LaTeX code.
  
### What you won't find here
* DGD content. DGDs cover mostly practice exercises, and these most
  likely vary between groups, semesters, and years. Plus, something
  something academic responsibility.
  
* Assignments, for reasons similar to those listed above.

* PDFs of books required for courses, at least, until
  [the Pirate Party](https://www.pirateparty.ca/) gets a voice in our
  government (which I sincerely hope will be sooner than later).

Occasionally, you may notice "*INCOMPLETE*" in all-caps. This denotes
passages where either the prof changed slides too quickly, or I was
stuck putting an ampersand in a `bmatrix`, or was doing something else
with tricky key combinations. I'll try to update these as profs upload
lecture slides online; if an *INCOMPLETE* is left on a document for
more than 48 hours, the uploaded slides most likely don't contain that
fragment, and that should be marked as an issue.

In MAT 1320, some of the examples are omitted. This is because there's
no way I could draw TikZ fast enough to keep up with the rate at which
the slides change. These examples are all on the course website, in
[this PDF](http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/pparent/September%2016th.pdf).

Commits and pushes will hopefully now be handled by `cron`.
